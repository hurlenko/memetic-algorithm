# Memetic Algorithm

Simple implementation of Memetic Algorithm written in python3. Memetic algorithms (MAs) represent one of the recent growing areas of research in evolutionary computation. The term MA is now widely used as a synergy of evolutionary or any population-based approach with separate individual learning or local improvement procedures for problem search. 

## Usage

- Install dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy
```

- Tweak constants in `ma.py`, fitness function, number of iterations etc.
- Run

```python
python ma.py
```
